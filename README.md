# Election-Audit Summary:

I propose that the election commission can use this pypoll_challenge.py script with some modificationsâ€”for other elections as well. In this program we analyize the election_results.csv file by iterating through each row and reading the datas from second and third columns,to calculate and find the results.This code quickly returns numerous data for the colorado Board of Elections.

This code can be used on similar projects such as other congressional district elections, senatorial districts, local elections, and more. Python script can find unique names of candidates and counties, we can reuse this code on a much larger dataset with more candidates, more counties or other areas.This script is also useful for files containing more information,like type of ballot or the date the vote was cast by importing dependency datetime.Here the datetime dependency will capture the exact time when the analysis was exceuted, to perform real-time results for election in progress.
